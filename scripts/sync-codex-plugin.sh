Choose the smallest workflow that matches the request, then load only the
reference material you need for that workflow:

- `ingest` and `ingest-collection` → `references/ingestion.md`
- `collect` → `references/inventory.md` and `references/research-infrastructure.md`
- `inventory` → `references/inventory.md`
- `dataset` → `references/datasets.md`
- `archive` → `references/archive.md`
- `compile` → `references/compilation.md` and `references/indexing.md`
- `query` → read the relevant `_index.md` files first, then only the articles
  needed to answer
- `lint` → `references/linting.md`
- `audit` → `references/audit.md`
- `research`, `plan`, `output`, `assess` → `references/research-infrastructure.md`
- `project` → `references/projects.md`
- `librarian` → `references/librarian.md`
- wiki structure, indexes, log format, file placement, init → `references/wiki-structure.md`
- hub lookup and path handling → `references/hub-resolution.md`

Collect requests create bounded catalogs of discoverable things: artifacts,
examples, resources, entities, tools, media, memes, or source candidates. Infer
scale and media policy, record aliases plus `found_in_context` provenance,
deduplicate candidates, write a `type: collection` output at
`output/collect-<slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, then create inventory only when the list
is small and durable enough; otherwise create or suggest one corpus record.
Download and hash bounded public binary media into
`output/assets/collect-<slug>/` by default for media-bearing collections, never
put binaries in `raw/`, and never present "all" as exhaustive beyond the stated
strategy and limit.

Inventory is first-class operational state, not a silo. Ingest, collection, and
collect workflows should suggest inventory when the user wants to track or
decide later.
Dataset manifests should link to inventory records when next actions or
acceptance state matter. Compile and query may surface inventory gaps, but
factual claims still need raw/wiki sources. Collect, research, audit,
librarian, refresh, plan, output, and assess may propose durable follow-ups as
inventory records, but larger pivots should start with a small sample preview.

Keep the first response short and action-oriented. Read deeper references only
after the user intent is clear or a write action is needed.

- Use absolute file paths in saved-output messages and markdown links for URLs.
- Append to `log.md` for every wiki write operation; never rewrite old log entries.
- Keep large writes chunked into multiple edits rather than one long generation.
- Read `_index.md` files before broader scans, and treat indexes as derived data.
- Use article `confidence` fields when answering and flag weak sourcing when seen.
- If structure or placement looks wrong, use the `lint --fix` workflow from
  `references/linting.md` instead of inventing a one-off repair path.
